## Intro

This is a python implementation of an overlay for streamers of Nimo.Tv. My friends asked for to implement a progress bar that tracks the current number of followers towards a goal since that wasn't available in their OBS tools.
The program uses chromium to render the js in the page and scrapes that information using regular expressions. That is a cpu intensive task to do while gaming.

Might not work as of today since the information is gathered with a very especific regular expression.
